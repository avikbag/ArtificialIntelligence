# Artificial Intelligence CS380

This course looks at the implementations and comparison of performance of AI algorithms. Within this repo, there are a few search algorithms explored. Namely, depth-first search, breadth-first search, iterative-deepening depth-first search, A star algorithm using various heuristics, mini max search. All of these are primarily implemented using STL in C++, with the exception of minimax, which was done in Java. All the source code will be available in the corresponding named folders. First order logic is also explored in theory.
